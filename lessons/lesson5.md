Byte code

 * Discuss how the VM works: program, stack, program pointer, stack pointer, etc.
 * Instruction pointer, program pointer, return pointer... stack frames... call stack vs data stack or are they the same?
 * We will be doing stack machines for their simplicity but future conversion to register based is possible
 * Overview of how it works, optimization, etc.
 * Examples of it: straight code, functions, calls into functions, the stack
 * Arrity checks...
 * Use project euler or other puzzle sources to test out your bytecode gen
 * Start with just printing as you "compile" to work out what data you need to actually gen bytecode
 
 * Skipping static analysis of the AST, depend on runtime instead (initially)

HW:
 * Finish parser
