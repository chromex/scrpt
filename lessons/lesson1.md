# Course Overview

## Course goals
* Belief that true learning comes from projects, not presentations
* Build a custom script language using C
* Develop an appreciation for performance and runtime issues

## How it Works
* Making and using a language is a multi-phase and iterative project
* Classes are the time to introduce new concepts, discuss approaches, check on progress, get help, etc.
* Will meet roughly once per week after work
* Requires commitment

## Phase 1: Designing
* Coming up with a base syntax set and formal definition for it
* Understanding long term goals that can impact the syntax
* Example languages: lua, python, ruby, javascript, etc. 
* Features: classes, typed vs untyped, syntactic sugar, 

## Phase 2: Compilation
* Lexical analyzer -- breaking down written code into tokens
* Parser -- converting the token stream into a meaningful syntax tree
* Compiler -- translating the syntax tree into bytecode

## Phase 3: Virtual Machine
* Design and build the runtime
* Byte code system
* FFI (foreign function interface)
* Debugging

## Phase 4: Game
* Integrate VM with a pre-built simple game engine
* Build a game using the new language: asteroids, defender, etc.
* Get the game running on a RasPi

## Homework: 
* Read up on scripting languages
* Freshen up on C -- The C Programming Language is a great book and can be found online
