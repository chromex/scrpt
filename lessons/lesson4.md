Parser
 
 * Overview -- AST, parsing approach (recursive descent), takes input from the tokenizer, tree nodes
 * Tests
 * Ambiguous syntax
 * Keep grammer up to date
 * Order of operations
 * Can't catch everything
 * Fixing lexer
 * Example of expression parsing and how recursive descent works with just math
 * Think about what your tree /means/ -- sometimes implicit knowledge can save a lot of work -- cleverness can really save you

HW (phase 1)
 * Start on parser
 * Must be able to output the resulting tree in some human readable form
 * Recommend to start with function and statement parsing
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser

HW (phase 2)
 * Complete parser
 * Unit tests for core supported code and "crazy" edge cases
 * Be able to justify how you can intuit info from the true
