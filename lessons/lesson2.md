# Phase 1: Designing the language

Base Project Overview
* c code
* class-less
* reference counted
* FFI
* leak free
* use to build asteroids game

Bonus features
* classes (actual, not prototype based)
* async / await w/ thread pool
* bytecode size optimization and cache

BNF for language

 * Describe the structure of BNF, history, etc.
 * Show an example BNF and walk through how it works, what it means
 * Work with people to start crafting their BNF in class
 * The BNF will be a living document, it will most likely have bugs

HW:
 * Finish your BNF and update your test code
